# agent-sandbox

A sandbox environment for developing, testing, and experimenting with AI agents. This repository provides a safe space to prototype agent behaviors, test different approaches, and iterate on agent-related code and ideas.

## Overview

The agent-sandbox project serves as:
- **Experimentation Platform**: Test new agent architectures and behaviors
- **Development Environment**: Build and prototype agent systems
- **Learning Space**: Explore AI agent concepts and implementations
- **Collaboration Hub**: Share and discuss agent development approaches

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git for version control
- Your preferred development environment (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Programming language runtime based on your agent implementation (Python, Node.js, etc.)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rzhao271/agent-sandbox.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd agent-sandbox
   ```

3. **Set up your development environment**:
   - Create a new branch for your experiments:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-agent-name
     ```
   - Add your agent code and documentation
   - Test your implementation

4. **Start building your agent projects!**
